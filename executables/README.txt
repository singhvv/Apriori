The project is made using a jupyter notebook (.ipynb file)
In order to run it, please select 'run all' in your IDE
The notebook will generate the 4 datasets and then start applying the algorithm to it.
The implementation of Apriori algorithm and Idea 1 is done in a single file.
We have also included the datasets that we used for our observations in the 'Datasets' folder.
The .freq files are stored in the 'freq files' folder.


To run the algorithm from scratch, run 'database.py' in the 'executables' folder
After that, run 'execute_this.py' in the 'executables' folder

Thank you!
